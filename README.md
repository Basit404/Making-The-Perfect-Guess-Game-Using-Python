# Guess The Number Game
This Python program generates a random number between 1 and 100, then prompts the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The program runs in a loop until the user correctly guesses the random number, at which point the program displays the number of guesses the user made. The program also includes a feature to update a high score in a separate file if the user breaks the existing high score.
